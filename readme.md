# Patagonio React App

This repository contains a React project created for a minimal landing page example. The project lives in the `homework` directory and was generated with a Vite style layout (the CLI could not be executed in this environment).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
cd homework
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Project Structure

```

  src/
    components/
    pages/
```

The landing page is located in `src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` and is loaded in `App.jsx`.
